<p>Hello, I am an undergraduate student at Gachon University majoring in Computer Science and Psychology. I am currently a research assistant at the university's HCI Lab, where I focus on the development and study of negotiation agents.</p>

<p>My research is driven by the vision of AI for Psychology. My ultimate goal is to design and develop AI agents that foster positive feedback loops within human society.</p>

<p class="mb-5">I am always open to collaboration and discussions regarding my research or shared visions. Please feel free to reach out—I look forward to connecting and learning from you.</p>
